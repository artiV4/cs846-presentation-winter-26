## 1. Guidelines

> **Note:** Guidelines should be actionable, specific, and usable during real coding tasks.

### Guideline 1: Create a structured instruction file [9].

**Description:**  

Add a Copilot Code Review instructions file that is concise, structured, and scoped to where it should apply:

* Use repo-wide `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for standards that apply everywhere.

* Use path-specific `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` with applyTo frontmatter for language/module-specific rules. 

Your instruction file should be concise and structured, consider including sections like: "Naming Conventions", "Code Style", "Error Handling", "Testing", and "Example".

**Reasoning:**  
LLMs struggle with complex tasks that require extensive contextual or repository understanding [5], and due to the inherent undeterministic nature of LLMs, their outputs can drift in unexpected directions without clear constraints. Github Copilot recently added support for repo-wide and path-specific instructions [9] so that you can define a universal and customized guidelines for your Copilot agent to fit into your workflow. By providing structured headings and bullet points, it helps Copilot to access organized and focued instruction. However, long instruction files (over 1000 lines) should be avoided, as this leads to inconsistent behaviours and may cause "Lost in the middle" effect [16]. 

**Good Example:**  

```
---
applyTo: "**/*.ts"
---

---

### Guideline 2: Use Automated CI Gates [8]

#### Guideline 2.1: Static Analysis Tool together with LLM [11]

**Description:**

Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., linters, type checkers, security scanners) into your CI pipeline and configure them as mandatory checks before pull request merge. GitHub CI supports assorted static analysis tool integrations like CodeQL (primarily for security), Semgrep (pattern based bug finding with customized rules), and your ecosystem’s usual linters/type checkers (ESLint/tsc, pylint/mypy, etc.). Compare the output given by the Static Analysis Tool along with the output from the LLM and use the tool findings to ground, verify, or challenge the LLM’s review comments rather than treating the LLM as the sole reviewer.

**Reasoning:**

Unlike LLMs, most static analysis tools like Semgrep, CodeQL, etc. are deterministic and rule-based. They enforce predefined constraints across all changes, which can provide a consistent and systematic guarantee to your project. Depending on its proprietary, static analysis tools are generally capable of detecting: Syntax and type errors, Code style violations, Security vulnerabilities, Dead code or unreachable branches, and Complexity thresholds. However, this is not in conflict with LLM-assisted Code Review, as static analysis tools sometimes lack flexibility and may generate false alarms. These tools should be combined together. 

**Good Example:**

An good example of static analysis tool pattern definition file using Semgrep could be found in `.github/semgrep.yml`. 

However, it should be noted that this configuration is illustrative rather than exhaustive. Please use the LLM to generate more suitable patterns, you can check the static analysis result using our example at [PR #11 -> Files Changed](https://github.com/U70-TK/cs846-presentation-winter-26/pull/11/changes).

Customized static analysis patterns should neither be overly broad nor overly strict.

- If it's too broad, it may trigger too many false positives. 
- If it's too strict, it likely will not catch anything. 

A good static analysis pattern definition should find a balance in between, and match project-specific conventions and expectations. 

**Bad Example:**

Static analysis patterns being too broad or too strict. Either:

- Too many false positives are captured, or
- Didn't catch any useful things.

#### Guideline 2.2: Use Automated Dependency Management Tools

**Description:**

Enable automated dependency monitoring and update mechanisms in your CI/CD workflow to continuously detect and remediate vulnerable or outdated third-party packages before merge.

**Reasoning:**

A large portion of modern security risk does not originate from first-party code, but from third-party dependencies [17]. Even if your internal code is perfectly written, a vulnerable library version can introduce critical vulnerabilities into production. Automated dependency management tools like Dependabot are continuously monitoring vulnerability databases and ensuring the packages used are free of known vulnerabilities, so as to mitigate software supply-chain attacks. 

**Good Example:**

In GitHub, fork the current repository (to make sure you have admin access), then go to:

Settings -> Security -> Advanced Security -> Dependabot -> Enable Dependabot Alerts -> Enable. 

Trigger a push on main branch, then go to: 

Security -> Vulnerability Alerts -> Dependabot. 

**Bad Example:**

```
You are an experienced coding agent, please verify the dependency versions for me: [path-to-file].
```

#### Guideline 2.3 Enforce Test Quality over Coverage [18]

**Description:**

Before approving a pull request, verify that automated tests are executed in CI and that the change is covered by meaningful tests. Ensure that the project’s minimum test coverage threshold is met, and dedicatedly review the tests themselves to confirm they validate real behavior rather than merely increasing coverage numbers.

**Reasoning:**

While static analysis and dependency scanning catch structural and known vulnerability issues, they do not validate runtime behavior. Tests provide behavioral guarantees and protect against regressions.

**Good Example:**

Ensure the PR followed good testing principles introduced in `Week 9 - Testing` on Learn. The test suite should be reviewed as a first-class component of the pull request, not as an afterthought. Enforce a team-wide test coverage as a threshold and integrate it into GitHub Actions. 

**Bad Example:**

Writing meaningless test cases to inflate high test coverage.

---

### Guideline 3: Be Extra Cautious about Binary Executables [13]
**Description:**  
Avoid committing binary executables (e.g., .exe, .dll, .jar, compiled artifacts, vendor-provided binaries) directly into the repository unless absolutely necessary. If inclusion is required, document their origin for accountability [1]. 

**Reasoning:**  

Previous studies have shown that many known CVE vulnerabilities are embedded within third-party components and precompiled binaries committed into repositories [13–15]. Unlike source code, binary artifacts cannot be meaningfully reviewed, diffed, or statically analyzed using standard development workflows. This creates a blind spot in both human review and automated tooling. However, opaqueness requirements do exist, and it also happens a lot in testing. Thus, binary files they must be treated as high-risk supply chain elements rather than normal source files.

**Good Example:**

Require the PR submitter to explicitly justify its inclusion. Explicitly document it for accountability. 

**Bad Example:**

Ignore it and merge it into the repo. 

---

### Guideline 4: Use a Structured, Context-First Review Prompt

**Description:**

When prompting an LLM for code review, first have it produce a structured summary of the pull request (intent, affected components, and high-risk areas). Then, give explicitly scoped review criteria (for example, correctness, security, and performance) as clear bullet-point instructions.

**Reasoning:**

Effective LLM-assisted code review requires context understanding before issue detection. Developers preferred AI-led summaries first to reduce cognitive load and improve contextual understanding before diving into findings [3]. Jumping straight to issue detection without grounding the model in the PR's intent produces unfocused, noisy feedback — which increases PR closure time and reduces reviewer trust over time [7]. Structuring the prompt itself with headings and bullet points further improves consistency and reduces ambiguity in LLM outputs.

Together, these findings converge on the same principle: the model needs to understand the change before it can review it well, and the prompt structure is what enforces that order.

**Examples:**

**Good Example:**

```
Ask the LLM to summarize the PR's intent first and identify high-risk areas, then instruct it to review only for a specific, named set of concerns.
```

**Bad Example:**

```
Review this pull request and suggest improvements.
```

----

### Guideline 5: Require Evidence-Grounded Justification Before Accepting LLM Claims
**Description:**

When prompting an LLM to evaluate tests or validate a reviewer comment, explicitly instruct it to cite specific line numbers, function names, or test cases as evidence before reaching a conclusion. Do not accept a finding unless the model can point to the exact code that supports it.

**Reasoning:**

LLMs reviewing code tend to produce confident-sounding but loosely grounded outputs, asserting that a test is missing or a security risk exists without pointing to the specific code that demonstrates it. Empirical studies on code review workflows show that developers only act on and trust LLM feedback when it is tied to concrete code artifacts rather than general observations [3]. Practitioner guidance on writing effective LLM instructions similarly emphasizes requiring the model to cite locations as a key technique for improving precision and reducing hallucinated architectural criticism.

Requiring evidence-grounded justification addresses all of these failure modes in a single instruction: it forces the model to anchor every claim in the actual diff before surfacing it.

**Examples:**

**Good Example:**

```
For each finding, you must:
1. Quote the specific line(s) of code that support your claim.
2. Explain the failure path using only those lines.
3. If you cannot point to a specific line, do not include the finding.
```

**Bad Example:**

```
Review the tests and identify what's missing.
```

----

### Guideline 6: Explicitly State Assumptions and Non-Goals

**Description:**

When prompting an LLM for code review, explicitly state what assumptions the model should make and what it should **not** evaluate. Clarify system boundaries, trust model, and review scope exclusions to prevent overreach and hallucinated concerns.

---

**Reasoning:**

Even when given context, LLMs may:

- Assume missing system components  
- Critique hypothetical architectures  
- Suggest redesigns outside the PR scope  
- Flag issues that are handled elsewhere in the system  

By explicitly stating assumptions and non-goals, you:

- Prevent hallucinated architectural criticism  
- Reduce overreach beyond PR scope  
- Keep feedback aligned with the actual change  
- Improve precision in real-world reviews  

This complements the structured, context-first guideline:

- **Structured, context-first guideline** → Controls *how* the review is structured  
- **This guideline** → Controls *what boundaries* the model must respect  

**Examples:**

**Good Example:**

```text
Explicitly list the assumptions about what the system handles outside this PR (e.g., auth, validation), and state what the model should not do (e.g., suggest redesigns, flag out-of-scope modules). Then get a focused review of what's within the boundaries
```

**Bad Example:**

```text
Review this PR and suggest improvements.
```

---

### Guideline 7: Understand the Intent Before You Review

**Description:**

Before judging any code, first establish what it is supposed to do. Read the docstring, inline comments, and any surrounding context. If the intended behavior is unclear, that absence is itself a finding worth flagging. When using an LLM model as part of your review, carry that same understanding into your prompt; otherwise, neither you nor the model has a basis to determine whether the code is correct or just internally consistent.

---

**Reasoning:**
 - GPT-4o assessed code correctness 68.5% of the time when given a problem description, dropping significantly without it [13]
 - Code correction ratio improved by up to 23 percentage points simply by including intent in the prompt
 - Without a specification, reviewers default to syntactic checks and miss semantic failures, code that runs but does the wrong thing
 - The same gap applies to human reviewers who skip reading comments before assessing logic
 - Missing or misleading documentation is therefore not a minor style issue; it directly reduces review accuracy


---

**Examples:**

**Good Example: context included:**

```text
 - State what the library is supposed to do before asking Copilot to find bugs 
 - Describe the intended behavior of each module, not just its file name 
 - Include any dynamic values or edge cases the library must handle correctly 
 - Ask Copilot to check whether the code matches the intended behavior, not just whether it runs 
 - Request a concrete verdict (Approve / Request Changes / Reject) at the end to force a judgment rather than a list of observations

```

**Bad Example:**

```text
Review the generate () function in fingerprint.py and tell me if there are any bugs.
```

---

### Guideline 8: Write Structured Review Comments

**Description:**

Every issue you find should be reported in a consistent format that includes the location of the problem, its description, the reason it matters, and the steps to resolve it. A vague comment like this looks unsafe is not actionable. A reviewer reading your report, or a developer receiving your feedback, needs all four pieces to understand and act on the finding. Use this template for every finding:
[Location] → [What] → [Why_it_matters] → [Suggested_fix]

---

**Reasoning:**
 - Practitioners rate review comments on three dimensions: Relevance, Information completeness, and Explanation clarity [15].
 - Comments missing any one of these three dimensions are considered low quality by real developers.
 - Structured comments reduce back-and-forth between reviewer and author; the fix is self-contained.
 - When asking Copilot to review code, requesting this format in your prompt directly improves the quality of its output.

 *Example:*
storage.py: search_by_error_type(), line 79
→ SQL string interpolated with f-string
→ Attacker-controlled input reaches the database query unchanged (SQL Injection)
→ Replace with parameterized query: conn.execute("SELECT * FROM crashes WHERE error_type =?", (error_type,))


---

**Examples:**

**Good Example: Structured Review:**

```text
 - Ask Copilot to report every issue using a consistent format: location, what, why, and fix 
 - Specify the exact output format so every finding is self-contained and actionable 
 - Group findings under clear headings so critical issues are not buried alongside minor ones 
 - Ask for a severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low) label on each finding so issues can be triaged by importance 
 - Request a concrete verdict at the end to force an overall judgment on the code

```

**Bad Example: Not Strutured**

```text
Can you check the crash_dedup code and tell me if there are any problems?
```

---
### Guideline 9: Categorize Every Issue Before Suggesting a Fix

**Description:**

Not all issues in a code review carry the same weight or urgency. Before suggesting any fix, classify the finding as a Bug Fix, Enhancement, or Documentation issue, and assign it a priority. This prevents low-priority style suggestions from being treated with the same urgency as a security vulnerability and stops reviewers from merging code that still has critical correctness failures.
Use this taxonomy for every finding:
 - **BUG FIX:** code produces wrong output, crashes, or has a security flaw. Must be fixed before merge.
 - **ENHANCEMENT:** code is correct but can be improved in readability performance, or structure. Negotiable priority.
 - **DOCUMENTATION:** missing or misleading docstrings, comments, or type hints.

Label each finding with its category and priority:
 - P1: block merge, fix immediately
 - P2: fix soon after merge
 - P3: nice-to-have, low urgency
---

**Reasoning:**
 - Analysis of 1,600 GPT-assisted pull requests found developers structure their reviews around three task types: Enhancement (60%), Bug Fix (26%), and Documentation (12%) [14].
 - Conflating these leads to unfocused reviews where critical bugs get buried alongside minor style suggestions.
 - Labelling by category and priority forces the reviewer to make an explicit triage decision on every finding.
 - It also helps the author of the code understand what must be addressed before merging versus what is optional.


---

**Examples:**

**Good Example: Categorized Issues:**

```text
 - Ask Copilot to label every finding with a category: Bug Fix, Enhancement, or Documentation 
 - Assign a priority (P1 (block merge) | P2 (fix soon) | P3 (nice-to-have)) to each finding so it is clear what must be fixed before the merge.
 - Use a consistent format for every finding so issues are comparable and easy to triage 
 - Ask Copilot to list the most critical issues first, not in the order it finds them 
 - Separate security issues from general bug fixes so they are never buried in the output

```

**Bad Example: Not Categorized**

```text
Review crash_dedup/ and suggest improvements.
```
---
### Guideline 10: Verify Every Suggested Fix Against Existing Tests

**Description:**

Description: Before accepting any change suggested by Copilot, check that it does not break code that was previously working. A fix that resolves one bug while silently breaking another is worse than the original problem, as it introduces a regression that may not be visible until production. Always re-run the test suite against a proposed fix and pay particular attention to exception handling changes, which frequently swallow errors silently.

---

**Reasoning:**
 - Up to 24.8% of AI-suggested code improvements introduced regressions, breaking previously correct behaviors [13].
 - Exception handling fixes are the most common regression source, adding try/except can mask real failures.
 - Fixes involving shared state (like the unbounded_cache in deduplicator.py) can affect multiple code paths in unexpected ways.
 - A fix that passes a casual read but breaks a passing test is not ready to merge, regardless of how confident Copilot sounds.
---

**Examples:**

**Good Example: Suggested Verification:**

```text
 - Ask Copilot to state the regression risk for every fix it suggests: Low, Medium, or High.
 - Ask which currently-passing tests could break if each fix is applied.
 - Request a correctness section that tests each function against all valid inputs, not just the happy path .
 - Ask for an improvement plan that separates what to change based on the risks.
 - Ask Copilot to flag any fix that requires human judgment and cannot be resolved automatically.
```

**Bad Example: No Verification**

```text
Fix all the bugs you found in crash_dedup/ project
```
---

### Guideline 11: Issues That Require Human Judgment

**Description:**

Even with well-structured prompts and guidelines, certain issues cannot be fully resolved by AI alone:
 - Cihan et al. [13] found LLMs failed to correctly assess code correctness in roughly 1 in 3 cases, leading to their proposed Human-in-the-Loop process.
 - Szymanski et al. [16] found that LLM-judge agreement with subject-matter experts ranges only 60-68% on domain-specific tasks.
 - Wang et al. [17] showed LLMs fall short on security, architecture, and regulatory decisions even when prompts are well-structured
 - Copilot can detect the symptoms of an issue, but a human must assess the context, risk, and consequences before making the final call
---

**Tasks for Human Evaluation:**
1.	**Manual inspection:** Carefully review each remaining failing test and trace the bug to the exact function and line of code.
2.	**Root cause analysis:** For each remaining bug, explain why the LLM failed to detect it.
3.	**Targeted prompting:** For each remaining issue, craft a precise, targeted prompt that guides the LLM to the specific fix. This models the Review Responsible role from Haider et al[15].
4.	**Apply final fixes:** Fix all remaining issues so that the complete test suite passes.
5.	**Final verification:** Run the full test suite and confirm 100% pass rate.
